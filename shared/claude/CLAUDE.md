# Global Git Commit Rules

## CRITICAL: NO AI ATTRIBUTION

**NEVER add ANY AI or Claude attribution to git commits under ANY circumstance.**

This includes:
- NO "Generated with Claude Code" messages
- NO "Co-Authored-By: Claude" attribution
- NO mention of AI assistance whatsoever
- NO emojis related to AI/bots (🤖)
- NO links to Claude or AI services

Commits must appear as if written entirely by a human developer without any indication of AI involvement.

## Commit Message Format

Write clear, concise commit messages:
- Present tense, imperative mood ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Focus on what changed and why
- Multi-line format for complex changes (summary line + detailed body)
